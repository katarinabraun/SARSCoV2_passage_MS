# Raw Data 

All ONT bam files other than the `primary_NP_swab.bam` file exceed the 100MB GitHub file size limit. We are happy to share bam files if requested -- our contact information is on the main README in this repository. 

However, all raw data can be found at this bioproject: [PRJNA607948](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA607948/).   

This bioproject contains FASTQs that have been mapped to reference (MT039887.1) and converted from an alignment file-type back to a FASTQ. We did this to ensure we were not uploading any contaminating human reads. 

The FASTQs from this bioproject can be fed directly into the ONT pipeline to generate bam files.
