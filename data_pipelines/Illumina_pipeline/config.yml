  #Oh man this is such an apples-to-oranges comparison. The fundamental question being asked is "What is the pre-test probability of any given nucleotide being different than the reference sequence?"
  #This number is derived in cancer from looking at the number of mutation per Mb in the tumor compared to somatic mutations. You can't really do that in viruses.
  #The closest analogy would be looking at the number of SNPs present in one ferret after infection with a standard strain. I don't know if people have done this,
  #Because mutation rate/replication cycle is so much easier to do.
  #This paper more recently estimated 1.4x10^-5 mutations/site/48hrs in influenza A, which seems like a reasonable estimate for a course of influenza.

  #Ultimately I don't know how much this will affect our calls, but it seems reasonable to try to estimate it accurately.
  #Another way of going about it would be this: Estimates seem to range around 5E-03 mut/site/year, so a 3-7 day infection should cause 4E-5 to 1E-4 mut/site/infection. 
  #Combine the two, and 4E-05 seems reasonable.
